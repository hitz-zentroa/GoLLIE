It was named after the area\'s first settler, George Gordon, in 1838. Gold was discovered in the vicinity in May 1858, and the mining town of Gordon soon grew by the Moorabool River. The goldfield was also known as Gordon\'s. By July 1858 300 people were working on Gordon\'s. It was soon clear that the gold reef ran all the way to Mount Egerton. By 1860 two companies, Kangaroo Bob Reef and Parker\'s, were working on the Gordon end of the field. By 1863 quartz mining in the division had stagnated. Only the Parker\'s Reef Company was at work at the Gordon end. Quartz mining was soon wound down. However, in the mid-1860s ground sluicing was still being carried out along Parker\'s Gully and the banks of the Werribee River (10 miles north of Gordon). In March 1868 the mining registrar reported that a large extent of ground had been taken up, stretching north from the Egerton mine to Parker\'s, Kangaroo Bob and Hicks reefs at Gordon.\\nThe Gordon Railway Station was constructed in 1879 by T. W. Cowley, on the Melbourne-Ballarat line, for the Victorian Railways.\\nNew quartz fields in the early 1880s led to a revival of mining in the area. Local infrastructure continued to develop, supporting Gordon as a mining and agricultural centre, and the Shire of Gordon was proclaimed on 29 May 1885. Summer Hill, Shamrock and South Shamrock companies all erected mining plant, including batteries, at Moorabool West, to the north of Gordon. Throughout the 1890s, however, the Egerton-Gordon line produced very little gold. One by one its principle mines suspended or cut back operations as known reserves were exhausted.\\nDuring the 1930s depression the price of gold rose from \\u00a34 to \\u00a38 and ounce. This rise promoted a revival in gold mining throughout Victoria. In September 1933 Daniel Toohey discovered the Gordon Gold reef - 60 tons from the reef crushed at the Egerton State Battery yielded 356 ounces of gold. Only one of the companies set up to mine the gold, the Gordon Gold Company, paid dividends, and it had closed by 1936. With the demise of the Gordon Gold Mining Company in 1939, the mining of kaolin (china-clay) became the main attraction in the area.\\nOn 19 January 1995 the Shires of Gordon, East Loddon and Korong, part of the City of Greater Bendigo and Shires of Bet Bet, Maldon and Tullaroop were unified to become Loddon Shire Council. Today the Loddon Shire Council area forms part of Victoria\'s Goldfields Tourist Region and incorporates the majority of the \'Golden Triangle\'. Encompassing Wedderburn, Inglewood and Dunolly, the Golden Triangle is reputed to have yielded up to 80% of the world\'s gold nuggets.\\nThe town of Gordon itself is today part of Moorabool Shire Council, formed on 6 May 1994. It was formerly part of the Shire of Ballan.\\nThe Shire of Gordon issued a medal to commemorate the 1887 Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\\nMunicipal Association of Victoria website http://www.mav.asn.au/CA256C2B000B597A/HomePage?ReadForm&1=Home~&2=~&3=~, accessed 09/12/2003.\\nBlake, L.

However, in the mid-1860s ground sluicing was still being carried out along Parker's Gully and the banks of the Werribee River (10 miles north of Gordon). In March 1868 the mining registrar reported that a large extent of ground had been taken up, stretching north from the Egerton mine to Parker's, Kangaroo Bob and Hicks reefs at Gordon.\nThe Gordon Railway Station was constructed in 1879 by T. W. Cowley, on the Melbourne-Ballarat line, for the Victorian Railways.\nNew quartz fields in the early 1880s led to a revival of mining in the area. Local infrastructure continued to develop, supporting Gordon as a mining and agricultural centre, and the Shire of Gordon was proclaimed on 29 May 1885. Summer Hill, Shamrock and South Shamrock companies all erected mining plant, including batteries, at Moorabool West, to the north of Gordon. Throughout the 1890s, however, the Egerton-Gordon line produced very little gold. One by one its principle mines suspended or cut back operations as known reserves were exhausted.\nDuring the 1930s depression the price of gold rose from £4 to £8 and ounce. This rise promoted a revival in gold mining throughout Victoria. In September 1933 Daniel Toohey discovered the Gordon Gold reef - 60 tons from the reef crushed at the Egerton State Battery yielded 356 ounces of gold. Only one of the companies set up to mine the gold, the Gordon Gold Company, paid dividends, and it had closed by 1936. With the demise of the Gordon Gold Mining Company in 1939, the mining of kaolin (china-clay) became the main attraction in the area.\nOn 19 January 1995 the Shires of Gordon, East Loddon and Korong, part of the City of Greater Bendigo and Shires of Bet Bet, Maldon and Tullaroop were unified to become Loddon Shire Council. Today the Loddon Shire Council area forms part of Victoria's Goldfields Tourist Region and incorporates the majority of the 'Golden Triangle'. Encompassing Wedderburn, Inglewood and Dunolly, the Golden Triangle is reputed to have yielded up to 80% of the world's gold nuggets.\nThe town of Gordon itself is today part of Moorabool Shire Council, formed on 6 May 1994. It was formerly part of the Shire of Ballan.\nThe Shire of Gordon issued a medal to commemorate the 1887 Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\nMunicipal Association of Victoria website http://www.mav.asn.au/CA256C2B000B597A/HomePage?ReadForm&1=Home~&2=~&3=~, accessed 09/12/2003.\nBlake, L.

It lauds the contributions of one of nation\\u2019s \\u201cfounding fathers,\\u201d and first Treasury Secretary.\\nThere was another side to Hamilton that the rap musical didn\\u2019t glorify \\u2013 his effort to privatize money creation in the new country from We the People to financiers through the establishment of the First Bank of the United States, an entity Thomas Jefferson called \\u201cone of the most deadly hostile against the principles of our Constitution,\\u201d which, \\u201cin a critical moment might overthrow the government.\\u201d\\nThe timing of the musical release took place ironically when awareness was growing of the modern dangers to private banks controlling the printing and distribution as debt of our nation\\u2019s money and calls by some to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill.\\n1916 \\u2013 BIRTH OF HERBERT STEIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF PRESIDENT\\u2019S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS\\nStein\\u2019s law: \\u201cIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\\u201d\\n[Sounds like our current debt-based money system \\u2013 an unsustainable system which can only continue if more debt is issued, which happens when banking corporations issue loans and purchase treasury bonds, bills and notes]\\n1836 \\u2013 BIRTH OF ALEXANDER DEL MAR, AMERICAN POLITICAL ECONOMIST, HISTORIAN, NUMISMATIST, AUTHOR, DIRECTOR US BUREAU OF STATISTICS\\n\\u201cAs a rule political economists\\u2026don\\u2019t take the trouble to study the history of money; it is much easier to imagine it and to deduce the principles of this imaginary knowledge.\\u201d\\n\\u201c[T]he State alone had the right to issue money and to decide of what substances its symbols should be made, whether of gold, silver, brass or paper. Whatever the State declared to be money was money.\\u201d\\n\\u201cLexington and Concord were trivial acts of resistance, which chiefly concerned those who took part in them and which might have been forgiven; but the creation and circulation of bills of credit by revolutionary assemblies in Massachusetts and Philadelphia were the acts of a whole people, and coming, as they did, upon the heels of the strenuous efforts made by the Crown to suppress paper money in America, they constituted acts of defiance so contemptuous and insulting to the Crown, that forgiveness was thereafter impossible\\u2026Thus the bills of credit of this era, which ignorance and prejudice have attempted to belittle into the mere instruments of a reckless financial policy, were really the standard of the Revolution. They were more than this: they were the Revolution itself.\\u201d\\n1944 \\u2013 BIRTH OF WILLIAM ENGDAHL, AUTHOR OF \\u201cGODS OF MONEY\\u201d\\n\\u201cSince 1945, American hegemony, or more accurately an American imperium, has rested on two firm pillars of support! The 1st pillar has been the role of the dollar as unchallenged world reserve currency in which New York\\u2019s Wall St. is the center of global finance, the \\u2018banker to the world\\u2019. The 2nd has been the role of the Pentagon and the unchallenged dominance of American military power.\\u201d\\n1989 \\u2013 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT (FIRREA) ENACTED\\nThe law passed in response to the 1980\\u2019s savings and loan crisis \\u2013 in which. FIRREA created the Resolution Trust Corporation, which bailed out failed institutions primarily through taxation. It also shifted regulatory authority from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Office of Thrift Supervision within the Department of the Treasury.\\nIt should be noted that more than more than a thousand felony convictions followed the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s and early 1990s. There have been virtually no investigations, let alone convictions, of those responsible for the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown triggered by US financial institutions.\\n1863 \\u2013 BIRTH OF ALFRED OWEN CROSIER, PROMINENT OHIO ATTORNEY AND AUTHOR\\nCrosier wrote widely against the power and influence held by Wall Street Bankers. Crozier wrote eight books, including The Magnet and U.S. Money vs. Corporation Currency, which served to warn the country of the replacement of the country\\u2019s currency by notes printed by private banking corporations. A wonderful display of political cartoons from his book, US Money vs. Corporations Currency is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4qQ59w4ML4\\n1868 \\u2013 BIRTH OF PAUL WARBURG, US BANKER\\nWarburg guided the operations of the National Citizens League, an organization formed in 1911 with $5 million in contributions from the big New York banks (including those owned by Rockefeller and J.P Morgan) to establish an \\u201ceducational fund.\\u201d The fund financed respected university professors to endorse the concept of creating a private central bank, which became the Federal Reserve Bank, created by the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.\\n1929 \\u2013 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEGINS TO TIGHTEN THE MONEY SUPPLY \\u2013 LEADS TO GREAT DEPRESSION\\nThe Federal Reserve sharply raises the interest rate it charges local banks to borrow money (called the \\u201cdiscount rate\\u201d). At the same time, it begins to sell its government securities (remember, the Fed is not part of the federal government, despite its name, but rather a largely private entity controlled by 12 reserve banks which are controlled by banks). These actions were the seeds, which led to the Great Depression \\u2013 as limited money in circulation prevents business and commercial transactions from occurring.\\n1930- BIRTH OF GEORGE GOODMAN, AUTHOR, \\u201cTHE MONEY GAME\\u201d\\n\\u201c[T]hose who live by numbers can also perish by them, and it is a terrifying thing to have an adding machine write an epitaph, either way.\\u201d\\n1943 \\u2013 BIRTH OF NICOLAUS TIDEMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, VIRGINIA TECH AND FORMER SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR THE PRESIDENT\\u2019S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS\\n\\u201cMoney is what people make sure they have when they want to buy things. Something works as money when people expect others to accept it as payment. Sometimes money is a valuable commodity, such as gold, wampum, or packs of cigarettes. More often, especially these days, money consists of pieces of paper.\\nThe pieces of paper that serve as money have sometimes been issued by governments and sometimes by banks\\u2026What gives paper money its value to the general public is the expectation that a party with whom many will have occasion to trade will accept the paper as the basis for crediting the person who presents it. The crediting can take the form of payment of taxes, payment of loans, payment of religious obligations, or, as with paper money issued by banks and some paper money issued by governments, the crediting can take the form of obliging the issuer to exchange the paper for some specified thing of value\\u2026\\nIn those cases in which the crediting takes the form of obliging the issuer to exchange the paper for a specified thing of value, the paper money can be described as the record of a promise to pay a debt on demand, and if that is the only form of money, then an expansion of the money supply requires an expansion of debt. But other forms of paper money are not debt. In particular, a paper money that consists of fiat currency issued by a government, good for the payment of taxes but not otherwise guaranteed to be convertible is not debt.\\u201d\\n1933 \\u2013 PUBLISHED REPORT, \\u201cCLOSED BANKS AND BANKING REFORM\\u201d BY CQ RESEARCHER\\n\\u201cThe many bank failures occurring in the United States during 1930, 1931, and 1932, culminating in the closing of all banks on March 6. 1933, and the failure of many to reopen at the termination of the banking holiday caused widespread concern as to the fundamental soundness of the dual banking system and of American banking methods in general. Provision for certain radical changes in banking practice was made by the Glass-Steagall act, passed at the close of the special session of the 73rd Congress. It was generally felt, however, that a more thoroughgoing reform of the whole system was needed. In this connection, the movement toward unification of the state and federal banking systems, with possible federalization of all banks, appears to have been gaining headway. While the views of the administration on the question have not been made known, it is thought likely that the President will recommend enactment of new banking legislation by Congress at the regular session in January, 1934.\\u201d\\n[NOTE: A reform not made was one that was suggested by hundreds of economists of the day \\u2014 to democratize money creation via what was called \\u201cThe Chicago Plan,\\u201d specifically for the government to create money as an asset (not as debt which is what banks do) and 100% reserve requirement of banks (i.e. banks could only lend money that they actually possessed).\\n1946 \\u2013 BIRTH OF JANET YELLEN, CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\\n\\u2022 (2005, speech in San Francisco) \\u2013 Yellen argued against deflating the housing bubble because \\u2013 \\u201carguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it\\u201d and predicted that the housing bubble \\u201ccould be large enough to feel like a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely be able to absorb the shock\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 (2010, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearing) \\u201cFor my own part, I did not see and did not appreciate what the risks were with securitization, the credit ratings agencies, the shadow banking system, the S.I.V.\\u2019s \\u2014 I didn\\u2019t see any of that coming until it happened.\\u201d\\nSo, what is Ms. Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed today not seeing and won\\u2019t \\u201cuntil it happens?\\u201d\\nWhy this calendar? Many people have questions about the root causes of our economic problems. Some questions involve money, banks and debt. How is money created? Why do banks control its quantity?

And how can the money system be \\u201cdemocratized\\u201d to rebuild our economy and society, create jobs and reduce debt? Our goal is to inform, intrigue and inspire through bite size weekly postings listing important events and quotes from prominent individuals (both past and present) on money, banking and how the money system can help people and the planet.

It should be noted that more than more than a thousand felony convictions followed the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s and early 1990s. There have been virtually no investigations, let alone convictions, of those responsible for the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown triggered by US financial institutions. 1863 – BIRTH OF ALFRED OWEN CROSIER, PROMINENT OHIO ATTORNEY AND AUTHOR Crosier wrote widely against the power and influence held by Wall Street Bankers. Crozier wrote eight books, including The Magnet and U.S. Money vs. Corporation Currency, which served to warn the country of the replacement of the country’s currency by notes printed by private banking corporations. A wonderful display of political cartoons from his book, US Money vs. Corporations Currency is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4qQ59w4ML4 Warburg guided the operations of the National Citizens League, an organization formed in 1911 with $5 million in contributions from the big New York banks (including those owned by Rockefeller and J.P Morgan) to establish an “educational fund.” The fund financed respected university professors to endorse the concept of creating a private central bank, which became the Federal Reserve Bank, created by the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. 1929 – THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEGINS TO TIGHTEN THE MONEY SUPPLY – LEADS TO GREAT DEPRESSION The Federal Reserve sharply raises the interest rate it charges local banks to borrow money (called the “discount rate”). At the same time, it begins to sell its government securities (remember, the Fed is not part of the federal government, despite its name, but rather a largely private entity controlled by 12 reserve banks which are controlled by banks). These actions were the seeds, which led to the Great Depression – as limited money in circulation prevents business and commercial transactions from occurring. “[T]hose who live by numbers can also perish by them, and it is a terrifying thing to have an adding machine write an epitaph, either way.” “Money is what people make sure they have when they want to buy things. Something works as money when people expect others to accept it as payment. Sometimes money is a valuable commodity, such as gold, wampum, or packs of cigarettes. More often, especially these days, money consists of pieces of paper. The pieces of paper that serve as money have sometimes been issued by governments and sometimes by banks…What gives paper money its value to the general public is the expectation that a party with whom many will have occasion to trade will accept the paper as the basis for crediting the person who presents it. The crediting can take the form of payment of taxes, payment of loans, payment of religious obligations, or, as with paper money issued by banks and some paper money issued by governments, the crediting can take the form of obliging the issuer to exchange the paper for some specified thing of value… In those cases in which the crediting takes the form of obliging the issuer to exchange the paper for a specified thing of value, the paper money can be described as the record of a promise to pay a debt on demand, and if that is the only form of money, then an expansion of the money supply requires an expansion of debt. But other forms of paper money are not debt. In particular, a paper money that consists of fiat currency issued by a government, good for the payment of taxes but not otherwise guaranteed to be convertible is not debt.” 1933 – PUBLISHED REPORT, “CLOSED BANKS AND BANKING REFORM” BY CQ RESEARCHER Provision for certain radical changes in banking practice was made by the Glass-Steagall act, passed at the close of the special session of the 73rd Congress. It was generally felt, however, that a more thoroughgoing reform of the whole system was needed. In this connection, the movement toward unification of the state and federal banking systems, with possible federalization of all banks, appears to have been gaining headway. While the views of the administration on the question have not been made known, it is thought likely that the President will recommend enactment of new banking legislation by Congress at the regular session in January, 1934.” [NOTE: A reform not made was one that was suggested by hundreds of economists of the day — to democratize money creation via what was called “The Chicago Plan,” specifically for the government to create money as an asset (not as debt which is what banks do) and 100% reserve requirement of banks (i.e. banks could only lend money that they actually possessed). 1946 – BIRTH OF JANET YELLEN, CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM • (2005, speech in San Francisco) – Yellen argued against deflating the housing bubble because – “arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it” and predicted that the housing bubble “could be large enough to feel like a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely be able to absorb the shock”. • (2010, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearing) “For my own part, I did not see and did not appreciate what the risks were with securitization, the credit ratings agencies, the shadow banking system, the S.I.V.’s — I didn’t see any of that coming until it happened.” So, what is Ms. Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed today not seeing and won’t “until it happens?” Why this calendar? Many people have questions about the root causes of our economic problems. Some questions involve money, banks and debt. How is money created? Why do banks control its quantity? How has the money system been used to liberate (not often) and oppress (most often) us? And how can the money system be “democratized” to rebuild our economy and society, create jobs and reduce debt? Our goal is to inform, intrigue and inspire through bite size weekly postings listing important events and quotes from prominent individuals (both past and present) on money, banking and how the money system can help people and the planet. We hope the sharing of bits of buried history will illuminate monetary and banking issues and empower you with others to create real economic and political justice.

It lauds the contributions of one of nation’s “founding fathers,” and first Treasury Secretary. There was another side to Hamilton that the rap musical didn’t glorify – his effort to privatize money creation in the new country from We the People to financiers through the establishment of the First Bank of the United States, an entity Thomas Jefferson called “one of the most deadly hostile against the principles of our Constitution,” which, “in a critical moment might overthrow the government.” The timing of the musical release took place ironically when awareness was growing of the modern dangers to private banks controlling the printing and distribution as debt of our nation’s money and calls by some to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill. 1916 – BIRTH OF HERBERT STEIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS Stein’s law: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” [Sounds like our current debt-based money system – an unsustainable system which can only continue if more debt is issued, which happens when banking corporations issue loans and purchase treasury bonds, bills and notes] 1836 – BIRTH OF ALEXANDER DEL MAR, AMERICAN POLITICAL ECONOMIST, HISTORIAN, NUMISMATIST, AUTHOR, DIRECTOR US BUREAU OF STATISTICS “As a rule political economists…don’t take the trouble to study the history of money; it is much easier to imagine it and to deduce the principles of this imaginary knowledge.” “[T]he State alone had the right to issue money and to decide of what substances its symbols should be made, whether of gold, silver, brass or paper. Whatever the State declared to be money was money.” “Lexington and Concord were trivial acts of resistance, which chiefly concerned those who took part in them and which might have been forgiven; but the creation and circulation of bills of credit by revolutionary assemblies in Massachusetts and Philadelphia were the acts of a whole people, and coming, as they did, upon the heels of the strenuous efforts made by the Crown to suppress paper money in America, they constituted acts of defiance so contemptuous and insulting to the Crown, that forgiveness was thereafter impossible…Thus the bills of credit of this era, which ignorance and prejudice have attempted to belittle into the mere instruments of a reckless financial policy, were really the standard of the Revolution. They were more than this: they were the Revolution itself.” 1944 – BIRTH OF WILLIAM ENGDAHL, AUTHOR OF “GODS OF MONEY” “Since 1945, American hegemony, or more accurately an American imperium, has rested on two firm pillars of support! The 1st pillar has been the role of the dollar as unchallenged world reserve currency in which New York’s Wall St. is the center of global finance, the ‘banker to the world’. The 2nd has been the role of the Pentagon and the unchallenged dominance of American military power.” 1989 – FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT (FIRREA) ENACTED The law passed in response to the 1980’s savings and loan crisis – in which. FIRREA created the Resolution Trust Corporation, which bailed out failed institutions primarily through taxation. It also shifted regulatory authority from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Office of Thrift Supervision within the Department of the Treasury. It should be noted that more than more than a thousand felony convictions followed the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s and early 1990s. There have been virtually no investigations, let alone convictions, of those responsible for the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown triggered by US financial institutions. 1863 – BIRTH OF ALFRED OWEN CROSIER, PROMINENT OHIO ATTORNEY AND AUTHOR Crosier wrote widely against the power and influence held by Wall Street Bankers.

to new land and capital. In fact, it’s something of a Catch-22 – you need land to farm on to make money, but you don’t have money because you don’t have land to farm. The difficulty of securing affordable, productive land is beginning to take its toll. The 2012 Census of Agriculture showed the number of beginning farmers and ranchers is the lowest it has been in 30 years, and has slid 20% in the past five years. “Farmland is the foundation of American agriculture,” says Julia Freedgood, AFT’s vice president of programs. “Success for the next generation of farmers and ranchers depends on whether they can secure suitable land with appropriate terms to start and expand their operations. AFT was one of 34 organizations awarded grant money by USDA via its 2015 Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. USDA awarded $17 million in total. “When new farmers and ranchers start their operations, [this program] can help them implement tested strategies and new ideas that in turn benefit all of us,” says deputy secretary Krysta Harden. This program was first established in 2008, intended to support farmers and ranchers with less than 10 years of experience. Grants go to organizations that can train beginning farmers and ranchers through various workshops, training, educational teams or technical assistance. For example, AFT’s “Farmland for the Next Generation” initiative will work on developing best practices and a comprehensive training program aimed at land acquisition. “While there are lots of resources available to help beginners learn farm production, business and marketing skills, surprisingly few are available to help beginners gain access to land, and most of them are region-specific,” Freedgood says. “This project fills that gap and addresses land access needs for the diversity of America’s next generation.” AFT will receive $699,796 to implement this program. In keeping with the “holistic” idea that the land, the livestock, the people and the money should be viewed as a single integrated whole: Part I deals with the management of the natural resources. Part II covers livestock production and Part III deals with the people and the money. Not only would this book make an excellent basic text for a university program in Ranch Management, no professional ranch manager’s reference bookshelf should be without it. It is a comprehensive reference manual for managing the working ranch. The information in the appendices and extensive bibliography alone is worth the price of the book.

"They\'re just a bit costly," says Henderson. Each window is 1.1 millimetres thick and ranges between 67 and 106 millimetres in diameter. The price for one is EUR 30,000 to EUR 100,000. It takes about two weeks to "grow" a disk of 1.1 mm thickness.'}

a BBC Persian interview with Turkish History Professor Ilber Ortayli of Galatasaray Universitry in Istanbul Turkey who outlines the long-standing cultural and historical ties between the Turkic and Iranian peoples since pre-Islamic times. Readers are invited to consult Professor Ortayli’s textbook in Amazon.com: For Persian readers, an article on the Professor’s interview has been reproduced which was originally posted on the Ahura News website. History Professor Ilber Ortayli of Galatasaray University in Istanbul Turkey. For the full BBC Persian interview and report on Professor Ortayli’s interview, kindly click on the above picture. Below are some excerpts from that interview: “The influence of Iran upon the Turks is like the influence of ancient Greece upon the entirety of Europe” This is a very astute observation, one that has been long overdue in academia. The professor then expands on the above observation by expostulating that: “We [the Turks] adopted much of our bureaucratic and governance methods from the Iranians during the Ottoman dynasty. We have been influenced by Iranian civilization since ancient pre-Islamic times. The only difference between us [the Turks] and them [the Iranians] is in our language groups…Persian is an Aryan language.” Professor Ortayli is cognizant of an important fact: the members of Persianate civilization are distinct from (and pre-date) the Islamic era. To this family may be added the cultures and civilizations of the Caucasus (Arran or modern Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Lezgians, Georgia, etc.) as well as Central Asia. The Yulduz Turdieva Musical Ensemble of Uzbekistan. The above video displays Uzbek singer Yulduz Turdieva singing in Persian accompanied by Uzbek musicians composing Classical Persian music. Western historians and writers often refer to the non-Arabian civilizations of the Near East, Central Asia, Iran, etc. as “Islamic” or “MIddle Eastern” . Professor Ortayli also draws upon the influence of ancient Iran, especially Zoroastrianism upon the Turks: “Our worship of nature and creed of Shamanism has been heavily influenced by Zoroastrianism. And in the days of Islam, all of our learned men/teachers who taught us were all Iranians. Even our alphabet is derived from the Iranians…because of our history with the Ottomans we continue to share a special bond with the Iranians”. The image of Zoroaster at Dura Europus. The professor also notes of European views of Iranians, past and present: “When I was a young man, the people of Europe had a different view of the people of Iran, seeing them as gentlemanly and noble…today the Europeans know the Iranians as a people endowed with culture, knowledge and a strong work ethic.” The professor then made the following observation: “There are two million Iranians outside of their country and the majority are successful and educated …the fact that they preserve their culture is a miracle…they have made remarkable scientific advances…they work very hard to understand cultures and people’s of the world…” Professor Orkayli emphasized the importance of the poetry of Molavi (known as Mevlana in Turkey) as the medium in which the Turks can become familiarized with the Persian language. The tomb of Jalal-e-Din Rumi, known as Mevlana by the Turks. Rumi is a highly respected and revered figure in Turkey. The literary links between the Turks and the Iranians remain strong to this day. The Turks have in fact done a remarkable job in preserving this site and are also credited for their efforts in preserving ancient Hellenic sites in Western Turkey, one example being ancient Ephesus. Recognition of links that transcend political borders and “nationalistic” sentiments”, has led the WAALM Academy to a uniquely successful initiative to foster Turkish-Iranian dialogue. At left is Radio Istanbul with their distinguished guest, the young and rising star, Ersin Faikzade and at right is the legendary Iranian singer Sattar being cited by the Turkish press. Iranian-Turkish cultural ties predate and transcend the oft-used term “Middle East”, a construct of 20th century Western origin. Cultural ties between the Iranian and Turkic peoples remain profound and deep-rooted. Iranian actors Homayoun and Morteza Aghili depicting street-toughs known in Persian as “Jahel” in the movie “Topoli” (the Chubby one). Interestingly, the almost exact type of street-toughs can be seen in Turkey – similar attire (hat, shirt, jacket, shoes), gestures, conversing, codes of conduct and even the minutiae of drinking tea, coffee or alcohol are strikingly parallel! The parallels in culture can be seen in recent history when Reza Shah visited Mustafa Kemal Attaturk in Turkey. Below is the first video in which Reza Shah of Iran converses in Turkish with Mustafa Kamal Ataturk of Turkey. The clip below was filmed in 1934 and was discovered by accident in a fruit shop in Istanbul after 76 years . The full story of this is found in Persian on the www.khandaniha.com website. Reza Shah of Iran conversing in Turkish with Turkey’s Mustafa Kemal Attaturk. This historic meeting serves as yet another highlight of the long-term historical relations between the Iranians and the Turks which has resulted in the phenomenon known as the Turco-Persian or Persianate civilization. There appears to be a resurgence of interest in the Persian language in Turkey, as seen in the video below: Teaching Persian in Turkey – Turkish instructor teaching Persian grammar to students. Note the enthusiasm of the instructor and the students. Iranians and Turks in fact share many common traits, notably in culture, music, foods, etc. While considerably downplayed by Western writers and “nationalists” on all sides, the reality is that Iranians and Turks are (at the very least) cultural cousins.# The list called result contains the instances for the following events according to the guidelines above:\nresult =\n    CulturalSignificance(relation="longstanding ties", historical_period="pre-Islamic times", civilization="Turco-Iranian"),\n    Influence(governance="adopted from Iranians", zoroastrianism="influence on Turkic practices"),\n    EuropeanViews(past="noble", present="cultured"),\n    CulturalPreservation(Iranians_abroad="successful", scientific_progress="remarkable advances"),\n    LiteraryLinks(importance="Rumi\'s poetry for learning Persian"),\n    CulturalInitiatives(initiative="WAALM Academy dialogue"),\n    CulturalParallels(similarities="observed cultural similarities"),\n    HistoricRelations(interaction="Reza Shah and Ataturk meeting"),\n    Resurgence(increase="interest in Persian language")\n]', 'unlabelled_sentence': 'The article below is derived from a BBC Persian interview with Turkish History Professor Ilber Ortayli of Galatasaray Universitry in Istanbul Turkey who outlines the long-standing cultural and historical ties between the Turkic and Iranian peoples since pre-Islamic times.
