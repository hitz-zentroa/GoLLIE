    "This notebook provides an example of how to conduct Event Extraction using GoLLIE.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, to compare GoLLIE with the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA), we divided the Event Extraction task into two sub-tasks: **Event Extraction** (EE) and **Event Argument Extraction** (EAE). The former focuses on detecting event instances in a text, while the latter, given an event instance, predicts its attributes, such as the persons involved and their roles. Additionally, GoLLIE is capable of performing **End-to-End Event Extraction**. In this notebook, we will demonstrate all three scenarios. This notebook covers:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the same guidelines as in the EAE task, meaning that we will define the `TransferMoney` and `TransferOwnership` events. It's worth noting that the ACE05 dataset includes 32 fine-grained event classes. But incorporating all of them would result in an huge prompt with a lot of tokens. While GoLLIE can natively handle inputs of up to `4096` tokens (which can be expanded using RoPE scaling to `64000` tokens or even more), we will keep this example simple by focusing on only 2 event classes. Feel free to experiment by adding more event definitions!! \n",
